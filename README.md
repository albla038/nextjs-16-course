### Implementation of [Jan Marhsal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbwu3-uz3Y)'s Next.js 16 course.

My learning goals for this course:

- Experiment with the new caching features of Next.js 16
- Try out Convex BaaS (very impresessed so far)
- Get up to speed with Next again before continuing my work on [Middagsflyt](https://github.com/albla038/Middagsflyt)
